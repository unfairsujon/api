 * Feed the outcome the provider actually returned through a proxy (captured around the
 * patched fetch and carried on proxyInfo.upstreamStatus) back to proxy selection. Opt-in:
 * only with PROXY_SKIP_RECENTLY_FAILED on does a refusal received through a member set it
 * aside for the existing cooldown; a success through such a member clears it. A success
 * from another provider proves the proxy is reachable but says nothing about that refusal
 * (a global pool is shared across providers), so it only ends an unreachable period. No
 * outcome (local refusal, network error), an edge relay (the outcome is the relay's, and
 * its key is null) or a direct request writes nothing. Never reads result.status: several
 * failures are generated locally.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose: the caller runs it as soon as the upstream status is known, so
 * a request picking from the pool right after already sees the member set aside. The flag
 * is read only for a refusal (a write); a success only clears what an earlier opt-in wrote.
