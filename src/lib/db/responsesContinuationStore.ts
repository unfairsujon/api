/**
 * responsesContinuationStore.ts — OmniRoute-native `previous_response_id`
 * virtualization for the OpenAI Responses API.
 *
 * Exposes `previous_response_id` continuation to clients unconditionally,
 * regardless of whether the actual upstream provider for a connection
 * supports Responses-API state at all: OmniRoute resolves the response id
 * back to the full input/output it produced and reconstructs the full
 * request server-side before forwarding upstream (full history, exactly as
 * today) -- the client only ever has to resend the new delta.
 *
 * Storage: reuses the existing call-log pipeline artifact (full, untruncated
 * request/response payloads, already gated by `call_log_pipeline_enabled`
 * and already retained/cleaned up by the existing call-log lifecycle)
 * instead of duplicating conversation content into a second store. Only a
 * lightweight `call_logs.response_id` index (154_call_logs_response_id.sql)
 * is new. Every lookup is scoped by `api_key_id` -- one client can never
 * resolve another client's stored conversation.
 *
 * Pending-write bridge: `saveCallLog` writes the durable `call_logs` row
 * (and the artifact this module reads) through a queued, single-worker disk
 * write (see callLogArtifactWriter.ts) that runs *after* the response has
 * already been streamed to the client. A client that fires its next turn
 * immediately -- normal in a tight tool-calling loop -- can reach this
 * module before that write lands, and would otherwise see a false "not
 * found" for a response id OmniRoute itself minted moments earlier.
 * `seedPendingContinuationState` / `clearPendingContinuationState` (called
 * from callLogs.ts, synchronously around that same write) bridge exactly
 * that window, applying the identical extraction/fail-closed rules via
 * extractContinuationState below; the durable row remains the sole source
 * of truth once it exists.
