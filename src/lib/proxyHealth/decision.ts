/**
 * Pure, network-free decision for the proxy health scheduler (#6246).
 *
 * Separated from the sweep so the status/removal policy can be unit-tested
 * exhaustively without any I/O. The sweep classifies each probe into a
 * {@link ProxyProbeOutcome} and applies the returned {@link ProxyHealthDecision}.
 *
 * Policy (agreed for #6246, extended for the auto-disable mode below):
 *   A — downgrade only after `removeAfter` CONSECUTIVE conclusive failures.
 *   B — an `inconclusive` probe (our own timeout/abort, or the probe TARGET
 *       erroring) never penalizes: it neither counts nor changes status.
 *   C — by DEFAULT (both auto-remove and auto-disable off) the health check
 *       NEVER mutates a proxy's status. It only counts failures for logging.
 *       A proxy's status is only touched once the operator opts in via
 *       PROXY_AUTO_REMOVE=true or PROXY_AUTO_DISABLE=true. This mirrors how
 *       accounts are only auto-disabled when the operator allows it — the
 *       operator owns their (often paid) proxies.
 *   D — PROXY_AUTO_DISABLE=true is the non-destructive sibling of
 *       PROXY_AUTO_REMOVE: at the same consecutive-failure threshold it writes
 *       `status: "dead"` instead of deleting the row. `"dead"` is already one
 *       of the statuses PROXY_ALIVE_PREDICATE excludes (src/lib/db/proxies/guards.ts),
 *       so a disabled proxy drops out of pool/rotation resolution immediately
 *       with no other code changes. Because the sweep keeps probing every
 *       registered proxy regardless of status, a "dead" proxy that starts
 *       answering again is picked back up by the same `outcome === "ok"`
 *       branch that already re-activates proxies for auto-remove — recovery
 *       is free once autoDisable participates in `managesStatus` below. If
 *       both flags are set, auto-remove (destructive) wins: a proxy that is
 *       about to be deleted has no use for a soft-disable in between.
 *   E — a `blocked` probe (the TARGET refused this egress IP: 401/403/429) is
 *       neutral like `inconclusive` by default (#10654). The proxy relayed
 *       correctly, so it is not failing; but it is not serving that destination
 *       either, which `ok` hid. Kept out of the failure count on purpose: one
 *       target refusing an IP does not make the proxy dead, and the operator
 *       owns the removal policy.
 *       Opt-in (`blockedResetsStreak`, the PROXY_HEALTH_BLOCKED_RESETS_STREAK
 *       feature flag): a refusal additionally RESETS the consecutive-failure
 *       streak, since the proxy demonstrably relayed. It still never counts,
 *       never sets a status and never removes. This covers 401/403/429 only: a
 *       relayed 5xx stays `inconclusive` (policy B) and keeps the streak.
