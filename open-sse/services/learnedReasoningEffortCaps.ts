/**
 * Learned Reasoning-Effort Caps — reactive capability memory for providers/models
 * OmniRoute has no static registry entry for (custom OpenAI-compatible connections,
 * or any registered provider whose registry entry carries no reasoning metadata).
 *
 * Same shape as `learnedThinkingCaps.ts` (thinking_budget), generalized from a
 * numeric budget to an ordinal reasoning_effort scale: on a 4xx whose body
 * enumerates the accepted values, `base.ts`'s executor calls
 * `recordLearnedReasoningEffort`, which stores the accepted set in a module-level
 * Map keyed "provider:model" (lowercased). Subsequent requests for the same
 * provider+model read the set via `getLearnedReasoningEffort` (consulted by
 * `sanitizeReasoningEffortForProvider` in `executors/base/reasoningEffort.ts`)
 * so the 4xx→retry round-trip is paid at most once per process per provider+model.
 *
 * `clampToLearned` implements nearest-tier clamping: smallest accepted >= demand,
 * falling back to the greatest accepted when demand exceeds every accepted value.
 * (#11295 — unified with the static "declared" clamp in
 * `executors/base/reasoningEffort.ts`, which already used nearest-tier semantics.
 * Before #11295, this learned clamp was downgrade-only — greatest accepted <=
 * demand — so the SAME accepted set {low,high,max} produced medium→low here but
 * medium→high via the declared path: identical inputs, opposite outputs,
 * depending only on whether the model had a static registry entry. #11274's
 * DeepSeek native mapping is the precedent for nearest-tier. This also fixes a
 * standalone bug: a request BELOW the learned floor (e.g. none/minimal on a
 * model that only ever advertised {low,high,max}) used to return null — no
 * clamp — so the too-low value passed straight through to the upstream, which
 * 400'd again on every subsequent request without ever learning a lower floor.
 * Nearest-tier naturally fixes this too: the smallest accepted value is always
 * >= any demand below the floor, so it is returned instead of null.
 *
 * In-memory only (same operator-accepted tradeoff as the thinking-budget cache):
 * restart resets, the first request after a restart may re-learn at the cost of
 * one upstream 4xx.

// `parseReasoningEffortEnum` reads it. Some do not: the body is an opaque
// "Invalid request parameters" / "Streaming response failed: [400] ..." with
// no list at all. Nothing can be learned from that text, so the request 400s
// forever — the only remedy is to try a lower tier and see whether it is
// accepted. These two helpers drive that one-step probe: pick the tier to try,
// and — once a probe SUCCEEDS — remember the whole range it just proved
// accepted, so every later request clamps without another round trip.

// The probe floor. `low` is the universally-accepted baseline on every
// OpenAI-compatible reasoning surface, so it is the safest rung to land on. The
// ladder deliberately stops HERE: the two rungs below it (`minimal`, `none`) are
// not just "less thinking", they are the carriers that switch thinking OFF. A
// probe that happened to be answered on `minimal` proves the model tolerates
// `minimal`, not that it wants reasoning disabled, so stepping down that far
// would silently downgrade a request's intent rather than repair it.
