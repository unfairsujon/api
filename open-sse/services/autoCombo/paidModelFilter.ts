/**
 * #6512 (follow-up to #6328 / #6495) — exclude paid-only backends from `auto/*`
 * candidate pools when the operator opts into the `hidePaidModels` setting.
 *
 * PR #6495 added `hidePaidModels` to hide paid models from the `GET /v1/models`
 * listing, but `auto/*` combos could still pick a paid-only backend into their
 * candidate pool → a 402/403 at request time, exactly what #6328 wanted to avoid.
 * This applies the SAME free-model predicate #6495 uses in `catalog.ts` to every
 * virtual auto-combo candidate pool.
 *
 * Kept as a pure, dependency-light function so the filter is unit-testable in
 * isolation without seeding the DB-backed virtual factory.
