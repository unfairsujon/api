// #14629 — the reactive reasoning_effort 400/422 clamp-and-retry chain,
// extracted from BaseExecutor.execute() (base.ts) into a standalone, callable
// helper so executors that override execute() without calling super.execute()
// (the majority of open-sse/executors/*.ts) can still reach it. Behavior is
// unchanged from the inline block it replaces in BaseExecutor: parse the
// upstream-advertised accepted reasoning_effort values from a 4xx body,
// record them process-wide via recordLearnedReasoningEffort (so FUTURE
// requests clamp proactively via sanitizeReasoningEffortForProvider →
// getLearnedReasoningEffort), clamp the live request body by re-running the
// sanitizer, and retry the SAME url once.
