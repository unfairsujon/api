/**
 * Tests for #13483: model-only lockout must be enforced for no-auth providers.
 *
 * Before the fix, no-auth providers (opencode, duckduckgo-web, etc.) returned
 * synthetic "noauth" credentials early in getProviderCredentials, bypassing the
 * model lockout check. A model_capacity lockout was recorded but never enforced
 * — every request retried the same locked model, paying a wasted upstream
 * round-trip (~2s) before failing over.
