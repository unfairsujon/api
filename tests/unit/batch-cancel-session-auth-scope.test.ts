/**
 * `POST /api/v1/batches/[id]/cancel` rejected the dashboard's own
 * session-authenticated caller as "Batch not found" (404) for any batch
 * owned by a non-null api_key_id -- which in practice is every batch created
 * through the default `env-key`, i.e. every real batch on the instance.
 * Cancelling from the dashboard silently did nothing.
 *
 * Root cause: the route carried its own inline ownership check
 * (`batch.apiKeyId !== null && batch.apiKeyId !== apiKeyId`) instead of the
 * canonical rule that `batches/[id]/route.ts` (GET/DELETE) and
 * `deleteCompletedBatches()` (GHSA-wvxc-jp3v-5mg5) already share: session auth
 * is the instance-wide operator, able to act on any record regardless of which
 * API key owns it. The inline check never granted that exemption, so a
 * session-authenticated caller (`apiKeyId === null`) was treated as a mismatched
 * key the instant `batch.apiKeyId` was non-null.
 *
 * This test proves the fix at the ownership-decision boundary — the rule now
 * shared as `canAccessOwnedRecord()` in `_helpers/apiKeyScope.ts` — against a
 * batch shaped exactly like the two that were actually stuck in production
 * (`api_key_id: "env-key"`), and proves the route source no longer contains the
 * buggy inline check. The route-level proof (a real session cookie against the
 * real handler) lives in tests/unit/files-batches-ownership-2jm2-m3hp.test.ts.
 *
 * Originally contributed in PR #13683 (@hartmark); folded into the
 * GHSA-2jm2-mpx8-6523 / GHSA-m3hp-hq9g-fpmv fix, which subsumes it.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   node --import tsx/esm --test tests/unit/batch-cancel-session-auth-scope.test.ts
