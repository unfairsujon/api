/**
 * GHSA-wvxc-jp3v-5mg5 — `DELETE /api/v1/batches/delete-completed` deleted the
 * completed batches of EVERY api key on the instance, and nulled the contents of
 * every file those batches referenced.
 *
 * Two defects in one endpoint:
 *   1. `deleteCompletedBatches()` carried no `api_key_id` predicate — the file
 *      SELECT, the checkpoint DELETE and the batch DELETE were all instance-wide.
 *   2. The route only checked that SOME key was present (`!scope.apiKeyId` →
 *      401), never that the caller owned anything. A key with `scopes: []` —
 *      an ordinary inference key — could wipe another tenant's batches.
 *
 * The ownership pattern this restores is not new: `listBatches(apiKeyId?)` and
 * `countBatches(apiKeyId?)` in the same module already scope by `api_key_id`,
 * and `batches/[id]/route.ts` already gates per-record access with `scopeCheck`
 * (session auth sees everything, a key sees only its own). This helper was the
 * one that never got it.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   node --import tsx/esm --test tests/unit/batch-delete-completed-ownership-wvxc.test.ts
