/**
 * Tests for #13457: cavemanConfig.preservePatterns must not be silently
 * skipped when a user region contains built-in preserved constructs.
 *
 * Before the fix, built-in patterns (inline code, headings, URLs, etc.)
 * ran first and replaced inline constructs within the user's region with
 * sentinel placeholders. When the user pattern then tried to match the
 * region, the sentinel was present and replacePattern silently skipped it.
 *
 * The fix: user patterns run BEFORE built-in patterns, so user regions
 * are captured as a whole before built-in patterns fragment them.
