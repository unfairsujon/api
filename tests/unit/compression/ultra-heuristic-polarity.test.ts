/**
 * Tests for #13454: ultra heuristic must not prune polarity/modality words.
 *
 * The ultra heuristic engine scores tokens and prunes the lowest-scoring 50%.
 * Before the fix, polarity words like "never", "always", "no", "not", "must"
 * scored 0.1 (stopwords) or 0.2 (length ≤ 2), making them the first tokens
 * pruned. This inverted instruction meaning:
 *   "must never be deleted" → "must deleted"
 *   "NEVER run rm -rf" → "run rm -rf"
 *
 * The fix adds polarity words to a force-preserve set (score 1.0) and stops
 * collapsing newlines (which destroyed bullet lists and code fences).
