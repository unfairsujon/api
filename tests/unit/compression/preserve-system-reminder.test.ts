/**
 * Tests for #13453: preserve <system-reminder> blocks from lossy compression.
 *
 * Agentic coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) inject project instructions
 * into user-role messages wrapped in <system-reminder>…</system-reminder> envelopes.
 * Lossy compression engines (ultra, aggressive, caveman, etc.) were rewriting
 * these instruction blocks as prose, dropping negations and breaking XML tags.
 *
 * The fix adds <system-reminder> to the preservation patterns so they survive
 * compression byte-identical.

# Deploy rules

- NEVER run \`rm -rf\` on the target host. Always ask first.
- Do not push to \`main\` directly; open a PR.
- The backup files \`.app-prev-*\` must never be deleted.
- Never store the SSH password on disk.
- Always run \`npm test\` before \`npm run build\`.
- Do NOT edit files under \`/etc\` by hand.

## Restart procedure

\`\`\`bash
systemctl --user restart app.service
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:20128/health
