/**
 * usage-provider-list-drift.test.ts
 *
 * `fetcherProviders.ts` and `supportedProviders.ts` are sibling pure-data lists
 * that have to agree: the first says a provider has a wired
 * `getUsageForProvider`, the second says the dashboard and server gates will
 * accept its usage. A provider in the first but not the second computes a quota
 * nobody asks for; one in the second but not the first is accepted and then
 * falls through the dispatcher to `default: "Usage API not implemented"`.
 *
 * Nothing compared them, and that seam has now produced the same bug three
 * times — #9603 (bailian: "fetcher existed, list entry missing"), #11722, and
 * #12256 (openrouter credits, requested again in #13080 six days after the fix
 * landed because the card had never appeared). `usage-families-split.test.ts`
 * pins the dispatcher against `fetcherProviders.ts`, so the open-sse side
 * cannot drift; this pins the other edge.
 *
 * Divergences are allowed but must be declared with a reason. An undeclared one
 * is the bug.
