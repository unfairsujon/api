/**
 * #13144 — error messages were being truncated after a path.
 *
 * `findUnquotedPathEnd` may swallow the remainder of a line when it cannot tell
 * where a path ends, so a Windows path with spaces cannot leak a `Files\secret`
 * suffix. Two things made that fire far wider than intended:
 *
 * 1. The licence was granted on `hasFilesystemEvidence` alone, and every API
 *    route carries slashes — so an ordinary `/v1/x/y` in prose qualified. The
 *    image-model 400 lost the one sentence it exists to deliver:
 *      built:     "...cannot be used on /v1/chat/completions. Use POST
 *                  /v1/images/generations instead."
 *      delivered: "...cannot be used on <path>"
 * 2. The ambiguity check ran *before* `resolvedExtensionEnd`, so a path whose
 *    end was pinned exactly by a known extension was treated as ambiguous the
 *    moment any prose followed it — costing the dashboard probe its
 *    ` with api_key='[REDACTED]'` tail.
 *
 * Now only an unequivocal prefix with no determinable end swallows the line.
 * The last test is the other half of the fix: this narrows what fails closed
 * and must not weaken it.
 *
 * #14110 (2026-09-21, owner decision) widened "unequivocal prefix" back to
 * include an unknown-root POSIX candidate (route-shaped or filesystem-shaped
 * -- the two are lexically indistinguishable with no second anchor), because
 * leaving an unknown-root filesystem path unredacted regressed HR#12. See the
 * "#14110" test below for the accepted trade-off.
