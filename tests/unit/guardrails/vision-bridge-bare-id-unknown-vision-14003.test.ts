/**
 * Regression (#14003): the Vision Bridge must not whole-request reroute a BARE
 * model id whose vision capability is UNKNOWN.
 *
 * `kimi-for-coding` has no MODEL_SPECS entry (the Kimi Coding registry
 * deliberately sets no `supportsVision`), so
 * `getResolvedModelCapabilities("kimi-for-coding").supportsVision` resolves to
 * `null` (unknown) rather than `false` (proven text-only). For a bare id the
 * registry and models.dev sync lookups are skipped entirely, so `null` means
 * OmniRoute has no static knowledge of that wire id.
 *
 * Before this guard the request was rerouted to a different provider's model
 * (`command-code/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`) with no error surfaced to the client:
 * the wrong model answered, billing followed the wrong connection, and
 * `call_logs` recorded the substitute as if it were intended.
 *
 * Fixture note: #14117 later gave `kimi-for-coding` a MODEL_SPECS entry (Kimi K2.8
 * Preview, supportsVision: true), so it no longer exercises the UNKNOWN-capability
 * path. The cases below use `deepseek-coder-6.7b` (served by `llamagate`), which has
 * neither a spec nor a registry vision flag; a precondition test pins that so a future
 * spec change fails here loudly instead of silently turning these cases into no-ops.
