/**
 * OpenCode Zen: which tool shape a request must carry depends on what it is.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-18 against the live gateway, on both the Responses and the Chat
 * Completions surface. A request whose instructions say "Never use tools" (the official
 * client's title agent) is accepted with NO tools and refused with any; every other request
 * is accepted with at least the canonical tool names and refused without. The request
 * contract used to fill an empty `tools` array unconditionally, which turned exactly the
 * title requests into refusals.
 *
 * The executor therefore learns the accepted shape from the refusal: a refused request that
 * received an injection is replayed once without it, and the shape that worked is
 * remembered per prompt so the next identical request goes out in that shape at once.
 * The fake upstream below applies the rule as measured.
